## seqDesign: Simulation and Group Sequential Monitoring of Randomized Two-Stage Treatment Efficacy Trials with Time-to-Event Endpoints
`seqDesign` is an R package implementing a modification of the preventive vaccine efficacy trial design of Gilbert P. B., Grove D. et al. (2011), *A Sequential Phase 2b Trial Design for Evaluating Vaccine Efficacy and Immune Correlates for Multiple HIV Vaccine Regimens*, Statistical Communications in Infectious Diseases, 3:1, Article 4.

Check out the following two vignettes, in this order, for a brief introduction to the package:
* *Instructions for Using seqDesign and Generating the Output PDF Report*, and
* *seqDesign's Report Template*.

The latter includes a report template PDF as well as the underlying code (Latex + R included in an Rnw file).
